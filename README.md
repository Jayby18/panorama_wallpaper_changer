Panorama Wallpaper Changer

Thanks for using Panorama Wallpaper Changer by Jayby18.

Before running this program make sure that all your wallpapers are inside your CSGO installation folder, more specifically inside:
"\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\panorama\videos\stored\"
Keep in mind that any folder inside that folder will be considered a usable wallpaper.

I highlz recommend using https://www.mruy.de/csgo-panorama-backgrounds/ for CSGO map backgrounds. (You will have to remove the subfolders for each map)

Also make sure that you have the original video files saved in folder "backup" inside the wallpaper storage folder and keep an extra copy somewhere entirely outside of CSGO just to be sure.
