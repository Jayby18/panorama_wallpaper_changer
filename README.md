Thanks for using Panorama Wallpaper Changer by Jayby18.

Before running this program make sure that all your wallpapers are inside your CSGO installation folder, more specifically inside:
"\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\panorama\videos\stored\"
Also make sure that you have the original video files saved somewhere outside of CSGO. So that if anything goes wrong with this program, you can still restore the original files.
