New in version 1.0.0

- PWC actually works if you don't have Steam installed in a path I for some reason chose (you can have your own path)
- PWC internal versioning implemented
    - If backwards-incompatible update is applied, user will need to do setup again
    - PWC keeps track of current version
- Code is more efficient
